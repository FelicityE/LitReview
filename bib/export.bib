So today I'm really excited to launch the Knowledge Graph, which will help you discover new information quickly and easily. Take a query like [taj mahal]. For more than four decades, search has essentially been about matching keywords to queries. To a search engine the words [taj mahal] have been The Keyword},

   abstract = {We propose a Dynamic Graph-Based Spatial-Temporal Attention (DG-STA) method for hand gesture recognition. The key idea is to first construct a fully-connected graph from a hand skeleton, where the node features and edges are then automatically learned via a self-attention mechanism that performs in both spatial and temporal domains. We further propose to leverage the spatial-temporal cues of joint positions to guarantee robust recognition in challenging conditions. In addition, a novel spatial-temporal mask is applied to significantly cut down the computational cost by 99%. We carry out extensive experiments on benchmarks (DHG-14/28 and SHREC'17) and prove the superior performance of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
