Autoregression: An autoregression model makes an assumption that the observations at previous time steps are useful to predict the value at the next time step.
    My Notes: 
    "An autoregression model makes an assumption that the observations at previous time steps are useful to predict the value at the next time step."
    If this is true then it means that AR expects the patterns to repeat to in time but this is not the case for EMG signals.

CNN: 
    My Notes:
    Chen2020, Asif2020, and Zhai2017 all try different ways of representing the EMG signals as an image in order to use CNN.
    Chen2020 depicts the activations as a heatmap over time making it effectively a video matrix
    Asif2020 makes a channel x samples/window matrix. Effectively also feeding it into CNN as a "picture" 
    Zhai2017 Uses PCA first on the dataset and adds the PC of each channel to a matrix that is sqrt(channel) x sqrt(channel). The PCs are added to the matrix where the most significant PC is at the center and the following PCs sprial clockwise outward to the edges. 


General Notes:
    Speech recognition is likely the most similar to EMG geusture recognition in terms of signal procressing.
    Prediction is not recognition
    EMG is not time series but instead a Markov process where the future states only depend on the current state not the previous states.

        Notes: 
            Other than in HMM it doesn't mention EMG being veiwed as a Markov process
